%DETECT_FEATURES Summary of this function goes here

%   Detailed explanation goes here



    %use harris corner detector

    points1 = detectHarrisFeatures(grayImg1);
    points1 = points1.selectStrongest(200);
    points2 = detectHarrisFeatures(grayImg2);
    points2 = points2.selectStrongest(200);



    %extract the pixel locations from the features

    [r1, c1] = deal( zeros(length(points1),1) );

    [r2, c2] = deal( zeros(length(points2),1) );

    for i = 1: length(points1)

        cornerLoc = points1(i).Location;

        r1(i) = round(cornerLoc(2));

        c1(i) = round(cornerLoc(1));

    end

    for i = 1: length(points2)
